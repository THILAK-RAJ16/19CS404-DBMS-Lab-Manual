# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose Address as Delhi

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

```sql
Select * from CUSTOMERS where ADDRESS="Delhi";
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the lowest dosage

Table Name: Medications (attributes: medication_id, medication_name, dosage)

```sql

from orders o join salesman s on o.salesman_id=s.salesman_id
where s.city="London";


```

**Output:**

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is LESS than $2500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

```sql
select * from CUSTOMERS where SALARY<2500;
```

**Output:**

<img width="1193" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7c85cf-5f6b-4ce9-bf54-ef72bcd12981" />


**Question 8**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders issued by the salesman 'Paul Adam'. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

```sql
Select o.ord_no as  ord_no,o.purch_amt as purch_amt,o.ord_date as ord_date,o.customer_id  as customer_id,o.salesman_id  as salesman_id 
from orders o join salesman s on o.salesman_id=s.salesman_id
where s.name='Paul Adam';

```

**Output:**

<img width="1234" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a409073-9f19-4205-8815-30f962035684" />
